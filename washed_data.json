            "Samburu Girls’ Foundation was founded by Dr. Josephine Kulea, HSC, whose passion was drawn from being from a pastoralist community and observing practices such as FGM, beading (to mark them for sexual engagement from an early age) and child marriage where the girls are married off from as early as 11 years.  \\nThe girls are given a safe place to stay and receive psychological support through counselling. The girls have overcome incredible challenges in their lives and have inspirational stories of hope. They also have a clear message for others in Kenyan society about the importance of eradicating these harmful practices and ensuring all girl receive a full education.\\nThrough the  Huawei, Safaricom PLC , UNFPA Kenya  partnership ,the livelihoods of the girls at Samburu Girls Foundation has been transformed , the girls have become empowered through education and have a place where they feel  safe to call home that is safe far away from some cultural practices such as FGM. This has not only transformed lives of the girls but also of the communities around .\\nHuawei is keen on youth mentorship as a form of personal development as it provides a platform to learn from others, and to also meet people or figures who they can aspire to emulate. It also provides the youth with an up-close opportunity to ask and learn on a very inter-personal level.\\nSamburu Girls Foundation was started in 2011, and has over the years succeeded in to rescuing over 1,000 girls from Samburu, Isiolo, Laikipia and Marsabit counties.  Samburu Girls Foundation has not only rescued thousands of girls, but has also created an environment for them to receive education from the primary to the tertiary level"

            "Government committed to have more women in ICT related jobs\\n\\nThe government has rolled out an initiative focused on encouraging young girls to take up courses in ICT, science and mathematics in efforts to boost gender balance in the fields and offer job opportunities for women.\\n\\n Maureen Mbaka, CAS Ministry of ICT, Innovation and Youth Affairs said that she started the initiative dubbed ‘girls in ICT initiative’ which encourages young women and girls to actively participate in careers in ICT, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM).\\n\\nThe CAS said that they are working together with KONZA Technopolis, Huawei women in Tech, and other partners where they have held mentorship forums, cloud computing trainings aimed at encouraging women to take up careers in the male dominated field of technology.\\n\\nSpeaking on Friday at the Centre for Mathematics, Science and Technology Education in Africa (CEMASTEA) during the closing ceremony of the Young Scientists Kenya (YSK) boot camp, Mbaka said that only 30 percent of the careers in Tech are occupied by women and there is need to have more women in the field as she expressed optimism seeing that more young girls than boys participated in this year’s YSK boot camp.\\n\\n“Next week is the girls in ICT week where every 28th of April we celebrate the women in the tech space. I would like to urge each one of us to use this time to go into our communities and encourage our young girls to take up course in ICT,” said Mbaka.  \\n\\nThe CAS highlighted that their mandate as a ministry is to facilitate universal access to ICT infrastructure and service to empower Kenyans in their quest for economic growth.\\n\\n“On tech skills, the government is committed to promoting the fundamental role that tech skills play in tackling real world problems and in furthering key 21st century skills required in the job market,” said Mbaka.\\n\\nShe said that the ministry has designed and prepared programs to prepare the Kenyan youth for the digital world which include the digital literacy program which is aimed at impact digital skills to young minds at an early age.\\n\\n“The program has seen the distribution of over one million devices in over 22, 000 schools as well as training of 300,000 teachers on digital skills,” said Mbaka.\\n\\nThe CAS said that the government also has the SchoolNet program which they are piloting and it involves connecting schools to internet services and so far 13 schools have been connected with a total of 1,500 schools earmarked for connectivity.\\n\\nCEMASTEA deputy director Lydia Muriithi said that next year the country will have the first class of junior secondary under the new Competence Based Curriculum (CBC) and they are working hard to see how sciences will be related at that level.\\n\\nMuriithi said that at the junior secondary they have the duty to make the students understand the importance of sciences so that they can specialize in the STEM areas when they join senior secondary and this will guide them in their career choices.\\n\\nYSK chair of the programs committee Ben Roberts said that the YSK in Kenya is modelled around the Ireland Youth in Science which transformed the country from a potatoes producing country into a tech hub housing headquarters for some of the giant tech companies in the world.\\n\\nHe said that in Kenya they are adopting the leave no one behind model where they focus on the rural and remote areas where the infrastructure is not so good and the students there find it hard to access STEM courses and the required teaching skills and laboratories.\\n\\nEnds…\\n\\nYoung Science Certificate Awarding Ceremony.\\nYouth\\nNairobi, Friday April 22, 2022 Kenya News Agency - KNA  by Joseph Ng’ang’a\\n\\n Photos by Widen Ratemo  Ministry of Information, Communications and Technology , Public Communication Unit.\\nCemastea \\n#stemchallenge",

While talking about the Fintech space, Mark mentioned \"People are changing, the Gen-Z is beginning to have spending power, and it will gradually increase. Habits are also changing. Today, everyone prefers simplicity and novelty. In order to achieve successful Digital Transformation, organizations must understand the kind of business to develop, the business KPIs, what technology to use, and the power of big data”\\n\\nTalks around digital transformation, digital, and digitization have ruled around different sectors ever since the pandemic. While, we won’t go further into the differences or similarities between the three terms, most people believe that digital transformation encompasses them all. \\n\\nWe also had Catherine Maina, Senior Cloud Solution Manager at Huawei Kenya breaking down digital transformation to four important things that a bank needs to look at. These are; Innovation, Infrastructure, Scalability, and Security. “In the platforms that you are building and the applications that you have, it is important that you think of how you are going to scale out with them. To scale out, you need technology solutions that will help you achieve in target,” She said."
